        Serving a cocktail before dinner is a courtesy to guests but it also
        serves a purpose. Known as an aperitif, the before-dinner drink prepares
        the stomach for food and the palate for the delicious tastes it is about
        to enjoy. Cocktails typically have a base liquor, like vodka or gin, and
        come with other flavored ingredients like fruit juice. Some drinks are
        simple and only involve two liquid ingredients. Other cocktails are more
        complex, involving a base liquor, several fruit juices, spices, and a
        garnish.
